DEV STAGES
X	create basic image mathmatically
X	create complex 
X	create basic functions
		get image
		find random image
X	create tiled images
X	create overwrite system
X		puts a nice ribbon on images
			i'm calling that one a victory/draw, it didn't fail!
X		adds 2dGraphics images
X		adds math defined square
		adds rotated image
		adds offcentre rotated image
		adds scaled image
	create collage images
X		random shapes
		vaguely anthropomorphic
	rework custom image filing systems
		make more unique so no overlapping npcs
		make so Paperdoll is designated artists
	create primitive limbs, body, head
		rip these from jam's work, temp measure until skills develop or other artists gained
	create collage with primitiv body parts manally

	create assembly system	
		most likely a class of its own, will initiate new DollPart class instances
		ability to read xml files
	create primitive paperdoll
	create more primitive body parts
	test generation of images
	refine code to remove inefficencies
	rework Paperdoll credit system
		allow Paperdoll cretis to be updated with artists who supply their own skins

	add articulation to image primitives
	rework assembly system to suport new articulation

	artwork detail for fat, muscle, hair

	embed into text

	minor animations

	sex animations

GENERAL NOTES
	All images should be refrenced from their top left corners, this is what java uses
	need to figure out how to deal with nested positioning systems for body parts
		find math for rotating rectangcle about positioning
	need to figure out trimming image math
		note: the corners are a rectangle's most distaant points
