    Add to discription text, detailing relationship
    Add saved longs for planning and proposing
    Add feature to invie npcs to wedding

GENERAL IDEAS
    convince rose and lilaya to get married
        requires you to have been married AND to have met lilaya's mum


DATING
    go on roughly weekly dates to improve passion
    general idea for a mechanic, NPCs will have a comfortale pay range, if you exceed it (even if you're paying), it might upset them and decrease passion returns
    if you turn up as something they're not attracted to, they'll cancel the date there and then, and passion will be lost
    mutual, you have to perform actions to increase their passion towards you, and you have a choise of how to react to certain advancements which will alter your passion to them
    can do triple dates if forming a polycule, though will be more difficult as you have to convince both your new parter and your old one to like each other
        selfish club partners might already have a partner (or two) that you will have to deal with
        other clubbers might already be married, if you have a companion, this might lead to a quick 4polycule
        you can attempt to try and woo all partners, or even try and sabotage their relationship so you can take one of them for yourself

MARRIAGE
    at mutual passion 80+, you can get married
    do through ashley, like with nyan
    max of 4 in a single marriage, so you can only do 3 in a row. Govt ordninace to prevent batchelors?
    npcs will move in with you, into your room. may limit amount of slaves permitted?
    children born in wedlock will stick about for 2 hours after birth before leaving
    the asker will walk/carry the askee down the aisle, unlike western marriages where the bride walks to the groom
    maybe the parents wait at the aisle to 'challenge' the asker

    marriage quest
    1   reach marriageability level with any partner
    2   talk to lilaya about it, she will guide you to Dream Lover
    2a      Liliya will prefer your marriage is not a public event, as not to drag her and her mother into it. different matter if post-demon
    3   Ashley will further warm up to you, being less abrasive. gives you ring and organizes wedding
    3a      plan out wedding, choose what people are wearing
    3b      Some time will need to pass to let ashley set it up, also allows you to invite friends to the wedding
    3c      maybe a fade-to-black, auto invites? do it in wedding planner?
