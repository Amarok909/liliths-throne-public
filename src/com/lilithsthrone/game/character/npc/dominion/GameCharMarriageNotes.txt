TODO
    Add proposition option to well loved npc
        won't be able to marry slaves without freeing
    Possibly need to go on dates with npc before marriage
    Add to discription text, detailing relationship


DATING
    go on roughly weekly dates to improve passion
    general idea for a mechanic, NPCs will have a comfortale pay range, if you exceed it (even if you're paying), it might upset them and decrease passion returns
    if you turn up as something they're not attracted to, they'll cancel the date there and then, and passion will be lost
    mutual, you have to perform actions to increase their passion towards you, and you have a choise of how to react to certain advancements which will alter your passion to them
    can do triple dates if forming a polycule, though will be more difficult as you have to convince both your new parter and your old one to like each other
        selfish club partners might already have a partner (or two) that you will have to deal with
        other clubbers might already be married, if you have a companion, this might lead to a quick 4polycule
        you can attempt to try and woo all partners, or even try and sabotage their relationship so you can take one of them for yourself
