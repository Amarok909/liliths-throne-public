	    [pc.speech(Hey Lilaya, does the concept of marriage exist here in dominion?)]
         Lilaya's cheecks turn a tinge red, [lilaya.speech(What? yes of cource [pc.Name]. Couples get married all the time.
		 Sure it's popularitiy varies with the times, going in and out of fashion, but recent tax benifits have seen an increase in marrigages over the last few months)]
         [pc.speech(Oh good, I wasn't sure if it was a thing
        #IF(pc.hasPesonalityTrait(PERSONALITY_TRAIT_INNOCENT) || pc.hasPersonalityTrait(PERSONALITY_TRAIT_SHY))
		 considering... the culture here.
        #ELSE
		 considering how everyone seems to be fucking someone new everyday.
		#ENDIF)]

        [lilaya.speech(Mmm, sure there is a lot of... causal romance going on, but like I said before, there are plently of couples who decide to dedicate themselves.
		 Well, some couples are more open to fooling about, and some are more excusionary, notwithstanding the occasional arccane storm; That's just a part of life. 
         But I'm sure we still have some things in common, like proposing, taking your betrhothed to a church or someplace similar, exchanging your vows, and then going off to a honeymoon.)]
        you nod in the affermitive, confirming your aunt's hypothesis.
	</p>
	<p>
        So uh, how come you ask PC?
        I like my partner NPC a lot, and i stiil plan on ggoing home, its just that they mean a lot to me and i want to show them that our bond means something
        oh PC, congradulations, lilaya says hugging you
	</p>
	<p>
		so how do you get married here? any thing special rules or traditions that i should know about?
        oh certainly, considering you don't have lilin, i imagine this is different to how it was back on your home world, but marriages usually happen in a day
        noting the puzzled look on your face, she continues, uh well, tradition states that you're meant to surprise your betrothed. this comes from an ancient incident where a lilin was swept of her feet and married that day"
					+ "forbidden lilin marriage, she was swept away one day and married that afternoon, so the ceremony is the same (having to surprise the bride)"
        though you can't just marry anyone, worker protection laws mean you cant marry your own or someone else's slaves. And although you are meant to swwep them of their feet, you can't force them to marry you; no means no.
	</p>
	<p>
        So how do i plan the wedding through?
        well we do have dedicated wedding vendors and specailists, hmm, i just can't think of any off the top of of my headd though
	</p>
	<p>
        coming to the rescure of her master, Rose speaks up. mistress, I do know of a particularly good wedding vendor
		Dream Lover, at the shopping mall. Although it is fairly unknown, both it's quality and reasonable prices make it one of, if not the best vendor in the city"
		rose, how do you know this?, lilaya asks blushing, and suddenly finding her tail interesting to play with. Knowing of the relationship your aunt has with her maid, you can easily guess what she's thinking
		one of my siblings used it, do you remember my sister lily? Though she did warn me that although the owner goes above and beyond in quality, they're a bit... temperamental;
    </p>
	<p>
        well PC, looks like you know where to go now. If you need anymore help, feel free to talk to me at any time

		telling them  the type of ceremony you want, ashley nods in approvral / harrumphs in disaproval. i can't belive it, are you doing this just to spite me, or are you that horny? no don't answer that, they say shaking their head. collecting themselves, they continue.
		 [ashley.speech(ok [pc.name], the type of ceremony that you've chosen comes bundled with a honeymoon package.)] Ashley informs you, before handing you another pamphlet. Opening it up, you see a variety of diifferent seetings. beach side resorts, cosy woodland inns, ornate hotels.
		 #IF(been to manor house on date)
		 Flipping through it, a familiar location catches your eye; Manor House resort. you show the pecific page to them
		 I've been here before on a date with a partner so I know a bit about it already, but can you tell me about these 'lovebird specialties'?
		 Not a bad choise this one, as you would already know, there's a lot to do there for the bargin price
		 #ELSE
		 Flipping through it, one particular package catches your eye; Manor House resort. you show the pecific page to them
		 "can you tell me more?"
		 Ah yes, this isn't a bad choice. despite the apperance and the high quality of service, it's modestly priced.

		[ashley.speech(Ok so now we've covered everything that you need, we can go back and change your mind.
		 But either way, here's a breakdown of the costs)]
		 looking over the list, you notice a few 'taxes'
		 So because i'm lewd I have to pay more
		 yup, you're making me put up with doing this, you're going to pay for it.

	<p>
		looking over the inteneiaty, you hand it back to ashly, [pc.speech(yup, this is fine.)]
		ok so that's everything sorted. now since you're going for a traditional wedding, i'll need two days to organise everything with my contacts.
		 If you want to change anything regarding your wedding, come talk to me before 9 in the morning and I'll get it done. The shop will be shut for the rest of the day as I'll be out organising everything.
		
		Then after that, you only have a week to propose to your fiance. After a week, my contractors will consider this a no-show and will cancel their preparations. If you actually want to marry them, <i>which you should have done that week</i>, then you'll need to come back here so we can organise another wedding.

		In short, you've got until [#SPECIAL_PARSE0] to make any last changes, and [#SPECIAL_PARSE1] to get married.
		All in all, that comes to [#SPECIAL_PARSE2] flames.
