    settle on using map or lists
    settle on data structure
        CHARACTER   BOND    STATUS
    make sure it adds itself to XML files
    make sure the game can read it from XML

    add addmarriage command

    add getmarriages command

TODO
    Figure out polycule/dating network system
        if there are relationships AB and AC, forming BC should collapse all three into ABC
        relationships ABC and ABD are separate, require CD to become ABCD
        relationships ABCD and ABEF are separate, requires CE, CF, DE, DF to become ABCDEF
            if only CE and CF are formed, then networks ABCDF, ABEF exist?
        example of mathematical network, can this be done without matrices?
            in fully connected, links = n(n-1)/2
        characters can be monoamorous (one parter only), biamourous (open relationship) or polyamorous (group relationship)
            devoted, open lover, and polyamorous for terms?

    Add proposition option to well loved npc
        won't be able to marry slaves without freeing
    Possibly need to go on dates with npc before marriage
    Add to description text, detailing relationship
    Add saved longs for planning and proposing
    Add feature to invite npcs to wedding

GENERAL IDEAS
    convince rose and Lilaya to get married
        requires you to have been married AND to have met Lilaya's mum
    if manor house picked as honeymoon, get a 'murder' mystery Black Butler/Midsummer murders style
        instead of being murdered, guested get fucked into ahego-mindbreak


DATING
    go on roughly weekly dates to improve passion
    general idea for a mechanic, NPCs will have a comfortable pay range, if you exceed it (even if you're paying), it might upset them and decrease passion returns
    if you turn up as something they're not attracted to, they'll cancel the date there and then, and passion will be lost
    actions are mutual, you have to perform actions to increase their passion towards you, and you have a choice of how to react to certain advancements which will alter your passion to them
    can do triple dates if forming a polycule, though will be more difficult as you have to convince both your new parter and your old one to like each other
        selfish club partners might already have a partner (or two) that you will have to deal with
        other clubbers might already be married, if you have a companion, this might lead to a quick 4X polycule
        you can attempt to try and woo all partners, or even try and sabotage their relationship so you can take one of them for yourself
            I can see this eating all my time already...

        hey uh npc, this is kinda embarrassing for me to say, but even though we've only known each other for a little while, i like you
        well damn, after that, how could i leave such a cute boy/girl like you here, how bout we find somewhere to go
        /will stay the night at their place instead of being booted out/
    Sub clubber
        hey, i really like you how bout i treat you to some place better than this?


MARRIAGE
    at mutual passion 80+, you can get married
    do through ashley, like with nyan
    max of 4 in a single marriage, so you can only do 3 in a row. Govt ordinance to prevent bachelors?
    npcs will move in with you, into your room. may limit amount of slaves permitted?
    children born in wedlock will stick about for 2 hours after birth before leaving

    the asker will walk/carry the askee down the aisle, unlike western marriages where the bride walks to the groom
    maybe the parents wait at the aisle to 'challenge' the asker, link to lore?
    if using Ashley, can only marry people in Dominion/Submission, Foloi fields have their own system

    instead of going door-to-door, to find each partner, go to one on the list and use one single dialogue node describing finding all of them
        like this idea, saves character walking round nonsense
        should put in tooltip "are you sure about this, after proposing to X, you will also propose to Y and Z as well"
    next dialogue node will be taking them to location, signing the paper work, getting them dressed
    next dialogue node will be the actual ceremony
    then honeymoon

    marriage quest
    1   reach marriageability level with any partner
    2   talk to Lilaya about it, she will guide you to Dream Lover
    2a      Liliya will prefer your marriage is not a public event, as not to drag her and her mother into it. different matter if post-demon
    3   Ashley will further warm up to you, being less abrasive. gives you ring and organizes wedding
    3a      plan out wedding, choose what people are wearing
    3b      Some time will need to pass to let ashley set it up, also allows you to invite friends to the wedding
    3c      maybe a fade-to-black, auto invites? do it in wedding planner?
    4   Find partner and give them ring, take them to wedding (if enough physique, describes you as physically picking them up over your shoulder / back if 'taur)
    5   Get heckin' married
    6   Final things before Honeymoon
    6a      demon transformation, give ashley a performance review to her government manager
    7   Honeymoon
