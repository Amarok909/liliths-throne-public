		hey npc, i know we've only known each other for a short while, but I really enjoy spending time with you.
		 You're really hot, handsome, kind, and you know how to show a [pc.guy] a good time.
		 This is hard for even me to say, but I really like you, will you be my boyfriend?

		 I know you've had a rough life, so I don't want to force you or anything

	<p>
		looking at your [npc.boyfriend], you think how to treat them. you could do something spontaneous, or plan something out.
		you wonder if you should also bring some others along and make this a group thing?
