		hey npc, i know we've only known each other for a short while, but I really enjoy spending time with you.
		 You're really hot, handsome, kind, and you know how to show a [pc.guy] a good time.
		 This is hard for even me to say, but I really like you, will you be my boyfriend?

		 Look son, you may be an adult, but you'll always be my precious little boy, and I will always love you.
		 How about I give you one of [pc.daddy]'s make-everything-better kisses, you say, taking your son's head in your hands and placing a kiss on his forehead

		#IF(pc.getTotalTimesHadSex(npc)>=1)
		#THEN hey npc, ive been thinking. we have a special relationship, I think we should make it offical
		#ELSE hey npc, i'm concerned about your romantic development, I think it's time you got a girlfriend.
				 but I want you to be prepared when you meet the right person for you, and dont think i haven't noticed the sneak peeks youve been taking at me, so will you be [pc.daddy]'s boyfriend?
		#ENDIF
