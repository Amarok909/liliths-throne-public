		#THEN hey npc, i'm concerned about your romantic development, A boy your age should really have a partner to depend on not just for sex, but for company.
				 I know you haven't had the best stt to life, and might not know how to go about this, so ive been thinking.
				 We have a special relationship, I think we should make it offical, will you be daddy's boyfriend?

		#ELSE hey npc, i'm concerned about your romantic development, I think it's time you got a girlfriend.
				 but I want you to be prepared when you meet the right person for you, and dont think i haven't noticed the sneak peeks youve been taking at me, so will you be [pc.daddy]'s boyfriend?

	<p>
		hey kiddo, i know we've been dating for a while, but i don't think things can last like this. I think we should break up

		 Look son, you may be an adult, but you'll always be my precious little [npc.boy], and I will always love you.
		 How about I give you one of [pc.daddy]'s make-everything-better kisses, you say, taking your son's head in your hands and placing a kiss on his forehead

		I'm sorry I had to end things between us, but it's going to be better for you in the long run.
